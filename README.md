# Dependency - SDL2
This is a distribution and CMake wrapper of the SDL2 library (available from https://www.libsdl.org/). It bundles the official pre-built SDL2 binaries (https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) for Windows in order to make it easier to build. Uses `FindSDL2.cmake` module (originally found in Twinklebear-Dev SDL tutorial: `https://github.com/Twinklebear/TwinklebearDev-Lessons/blob/master/cmake/FindSDL2.cmake`) on other platforms.

# Usage

Three CMake variables are returned:

`${SDL2_FOUND}`: Variable that signals whether SDL2 is available or not.

`${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS}`: The headers you need to include with `include_directories()` or similar.

`${SDL2_LIBRARIES}`: The libraries you need to link your to with `target_link_libraries()`.

`${SDL2_RUNTIME_FILES}`: The path to runtime files. On Windows this is the `SDL2.dll`.

## Easy way
Just copy this entire distribution and manually place it in your CMake project. Alternatively you could use something like git submodules, but you will have to figure that out yourself. Simply add this directory with `add_subdirectory()` in your `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Smart way
Use the [DownloadProject](https://github.com/Crascit/DownloadProject) to download this SDL2 distribution during CMake configuration time. Example code:

~~~cmake
include(DownloadProject.cmake)
message("Acquiring SDL2")
download_project(
	PROJ                sdl2
	PREFIX              externals
	GIT_REPOSITORY      https://github.com/PhantasyEngine/Dependency-SDL2.git
	GIT_TAG             <INSERT GIT HASH FOR VERSION YOU WANT HERE>
	UPDATE_DISCONNECTED 1
	QUIET
)
add_subdirectory(${sdl2_SOURCE_DIR})
message("Finished acquiring SDL2")
# ${SDL2_FOUND}, ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS}, ${SDL2_LIBRARIES} and ${SDL2_RUNTIME_FILES} is available at this point

# Copy DLLs when building with Visual Studio
if(MSVC)
	file(COPY ${SDL2_RUNTIME_FILES} DESTINATION ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Debug)
	file(COPY ${SDL2_RUNTIME_FILES} DESTINATION ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/RelWithDebInfo)
	file(COPY ${SDL2_RUNTIME_FILES} DESTINATION ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Release)
endif()

The sole exception being the `FindSDL2.cmake` module, which is under unknown license (but likely BSD "the license" to Kitware). Feel free to do whatever you want with this wrapper, but it would be nice if you kept this readme and the header in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.
